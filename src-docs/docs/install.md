# How to install DuCoPi

[TOC]

## Linux

On *Debian*-like distributions, including *Ubuntu*, the easy way is to download and install the *.deb* package.  
If you want *DuCoPi* to start with your system, add the `ducopi` command to the startup programs.

On other distributions, you can download the *appImage* file and make it executable.  
If you want *DuCoPi* to start with your system, add the `DuCoPi.AppImage` file to the startup programs.

## Windows

Just unzip all the files from the *zip* archive you've downloaded, and run `DuCoPi.exe`. You can create a shortcut to this executable file; if it's in the startup subfolder of the start menu folder, *DuCoPi* will automatically start with the Windows session.

## MacOS

You can copy the `DuCoPi.app` from the *dmg* file to your Applications. **To pick screen colors**, you will have to **allow DuCoPi to record the screen** in your system security settings. To make it start with the session, either add it to your *dock* and check the option, or add it in the startup applications for your user in the *users & groups* system settings.
